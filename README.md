# Decision Intelligence Platform for Transactional Businesses

## Overview

Transactional businesses generate large volumes of sales and inventory data, but most of this data is never transformed into clear, actionable decisions.

This project aims to bridge that gap by converting raw transactional data into **decision-ready insights** that help business owners and managers act with confidence.

This is not a dashboard-first system.
It is a **decision-first platform**.

## Problem Statement

Small and medium transactional businesses often face:

* Stock-outs of fast-moving products
* Excess cash locked in slow-moving inventory
* Poor visibility into which products truly drive value
* Reactive decisions made too late

Although data exists, it is rarely structured to answer practical business questions.

## Project Objective

To design and implement a system that:

* Identifies inventory risks before they occur
* Highlights products that negatively impact cash flow
* Recommends clear, explainable actions
* Presents insights in plain language for non-technical users

* Retail business owners
* Pharmacy managers
* Small distributors
* Operational decision-makers

This platform is **not** designed for analysts or data scientists.
